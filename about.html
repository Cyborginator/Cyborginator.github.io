  <p>Chris Weber is a designer/maker at SJSU, and his work generally revolves around cosplay or thinking outside the box for projects. He explores works that are semi challenging and usually related to 3D printing, as that's what he wants to focus on making a career out of once he graduates in Digital Media Art. He was previously a Computer Engineering major and as such has some background in coding, but while he found it interesting he didn’t find it engaging enough as he wanted to get creative which is why he switched to an art major. He tries to find ways to apply his skills or knowledge, such as CAD modeling and 3D printing. He also like adding little extra touches to the project if he can, usually being electronics such as LEDs as it makes something already cool like an Iron Giant figure or cosplay prop really stand out.</p>
  <p>Ever since he got his own 3D printer years ago he has improved his skills in how to get the best prints as well as how to model it to be ready to print. This varies from adding in built in support material or modeling objects to be ready for different colors by swapping filament at different layer heights. 3D printing is a really great tool for him as his art mostly centers around making stuff that is either hard to obtain or doesn’t exist, and while previously he worked with hand making sculptures using clay like material he finds it much more convenient to model it instead for 3D printing. While he may have hit the limit for what he can learn and accomplish with plastic FDM 3D printing he hopes to expand his skills as he gets access to more advanced tools such as resin SLA printing or nylon powder printers. His hope is to get a job for a 3D printing company and feels confident that he’s on the right track and is hopeful for the growing future of 3D printing.</p>
