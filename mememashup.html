	 <p>This project is a mashup of some of my favorite internet memes, the frog 'Dat Boi' and Pokemon. This created a new twist on the meme, as there have been many different versions of "Who's that Pokemon?" with different memes.</p>
	<img src="who'sthatpokemondatboi.gif" class="img-rounded img-responsive" alt "Pokemon Dat Boi Animated" class="center-block" >
	<p></p>
	<p> To create this I found a example Adobe AfterEffects file online that had the animation Pokemon background I needed. Then I extracted each frame as a jpg and imported it into Photoshop, and edited the text and Dat Boi in. I had them slowly fade in using transparency percentages to make it match the original Pokemon video. To make it animated I extracted the layers as jpgs and imported them in Gimp, then exported it as a GIF.</p>
	<p>This was all more than the assignment asked for but I wanted to put my own creative twist on it using the design skills I have.</p>
